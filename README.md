# Concurrent Labyrinth Search Program

The following is a C++ program to scape from a labyrinth by using multiple threads that counts the minimum number of steps in order to solve it. It was written as part of the INGENIA Systems Engineering subject at Technical University of Madrid.

## User Guide
Just locate the ```.txt``` labyrinth file you want to solve in the ```/labyrinth``` folder and write its name as an argument after the program execution command. You will be asked if you want to display the labyrinth solver, type 1 (Yes) or 0 (No) depending on your preferences. Once the labyrinth is solved you will get a report showing the information for each of the created threads and the minimum number of steps required to solve the labyrinth, as well as the required time to solve it.
